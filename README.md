# Password-Generator

## Description

This password generator was created using starter code for challenge 3 of the bootcamp. The goal of the password generator is to generate a password from 8-128 characters with certain parameters based on user input, namely, character type and password length.

## Usage

This password generator is designed to generate strings of characters based on user input. The user clicks the "Generate Password" button, then provides answers to a series of prompts, to generate a password that meets the criteria of the inputs provided. The methods used ensure grading criteria were met, but the security of the strings generated is questionable, and the strings generated should not be used as passwords.
